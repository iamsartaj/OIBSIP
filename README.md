OIBSIP Task2 : Number Guessing Game

Java game that allows users to guess a generated random number. The system will generate a random number (ranging from 1 to 100). Now the user will check his guessed number to see whether it is correct or not. If the user's number is equal to the generated random number, then the user will win the game and get his final score. The user would have totally 5 chances; if the user fails to guess the correct number in all 5 chances, then he will lose the game and his final score will be 0.
